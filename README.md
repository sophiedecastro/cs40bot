# hw03: creating a reddit bot

## candidates

my bot supports Joe Biden and opposes Donald Trump

## my favorite thread

![my favorite thread involving my bot](fav_thread.png)

this is one of my favorite threads involving my bot because the comment it is replying to talks about how Biden is too old and won't survive long enough to have a second term. I think it's interesting (yet coincidental) that my bot is aruging in response that the country is the one that can't survive another four years of Trump.
